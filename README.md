This project was a collaboration between Matthias Philippine, Alex Sharata, and Emily Johnson in EN 600.120 (02).

Compilation notes:

Compile with g++ -std=c++11 -pedantic -Wall -O *.cpp when running in a POSIX environment, or use the included Makefile.

PLEASE READ NOTES BELOw

Because of unfinished debugging, the makefile will generate a few errors, so please do not
compile with the makefile, it is unfinishehd. There are compile instructions at the top of
test classes for you to conveniently run the test classes and get an idea of how much code
we have written and the tests we have made. Thank you for reading me! -Team 7
